You will conduct several real-world activities as a junior data analyst in this case study. You'll work for Cyclistic, a fictional company where you'll meet a variety of characters and team members. You will use the steps of the data analysis process to answer the main business questions: ask, prepare, process, analyse, communicate, and act. The Case Study Roadmap tables will guide you along the process, with guiding questions and crucial activities to keep you on track. You will have a portfolio-ready case study by the end of this class. Download the packet and refer to the case study's details at any time.
