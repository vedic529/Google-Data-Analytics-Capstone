# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone
We will conduct several real-world activities as a junior data analyst in this case study. We'll work for Cyclistic, a fictional company where we'll meet a variety of characters and team members. We will use the steps of the data analysis process to answer the main business questions: ask, prepare, process, analyse, communicate, and act. The Case Study Roadmap tables will guide you along the process, with guiding questions and crucial activities to keep you on track. We will have a portfolio-ready case study by the end of this class. Download the packet and refer to the case study's details at any time.

# About the company

Cyclistic developed a successful bike-share programme in 2016. Since then, the initiative has grown to include a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into 692 stations throughout Chicago. Bikes can be unlocked at any station and returned to any other in the system at any time. Until date, Cyclistic's marketing strategy has focused on raising general awareness and appealing to a wide range of consumers.
The flexibility of its pricing structures, which included single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, was one strategy that helped make these things possible.

Casual riders are customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes. Cyclistic members are customers who purchase annual memberships. Annual members are substantially more profitable than casual riders, according to Cyclistic's financial analysts. Despite the fact that the pricing flexibility allows Cyclistic attract more clients, Moreno feels that increasing the number of annual members will be critical to future growth.

Rather of launching an all-new marketing effort, Moreno feels there is a strong potential of converting casual passengers into subscribers. Casual riders, she says, are already aware of the Cyclistic programme and have chosen it for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do
that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders dier, why casual
riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
